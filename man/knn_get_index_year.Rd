\title{Get the index years using k-nearest neighbor method}
\usage{
knn_get_index_year(ann_flow, ann_index_flow, k_weights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ann_flow}{A 2-column matrix, with years in column 1, and an annual flow
in column 2. This is the annual flow that needs to be disaggregated.}

\item{ann_index_flow}{A 2-column matrix, with years in column 1, and an
annual flow in column 2. This is the index gage that the flows in
\code{ann_flow} will be compared to. After the comparison, the nearest neighbor
year is selected.}

\item{k_weights}{If \code{NULL}, parameters are set based on definitions in Nowak
et al. (2010). Users may force \code{k} and the \code{weights} by specifiying this
argument. It should be a list with two named entries: \code{k} and \code{weights}.
\code{k} should be a single integer specifying the number of neightbors to
select from. \code{weights} should be a vector with length equal to \code{k},
specifying the weights to apply to the 1-\code{k} neighbors for selecting the
neighbor.}
}
\value{
N x 1 matrix of index years, with the number of rows, equal to the
number of rows in \code{ann_flow}.
}
\description{
For an index gage, select the years that are closest to a flow that needs to
be disaggregated, based on k-nearest neighbor selection.
}
\examples{
# a sample of three years of flow data
flow_mat <- cbind(c(2000, 2001, 2002), c(1400, 1567, 1325))
# made up historical data to use as index years
ind_flow <- cbind(1901:1980, rnorm(80, mean = 1500, sd = 300))
knn_get_index_year(flow_mat, ind_flow)
